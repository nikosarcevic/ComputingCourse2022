# ComputingCourse2022

A collection of data and code used for the Scientific Computation with Python - MAS2806-PHY2039 lectures at Newcastle University, fall 2022.
The course is tailored for second year undergrad students of maths, stats and physics with little to no python background.

I welcome any/all suggestions in order to improve the code (or correct the typos).
Feel free to use the code for educational purposes (do not forget to give credit).
