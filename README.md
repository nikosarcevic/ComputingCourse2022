# ComputingCourse2022

A collection of data and code used for the Scientific Computation with Python - MAS2806-PHY2039 lectures at Newcastle University, fall 2022.
The course is tailored for second year undergrad students of maths, stats and physics with little to no computing/coding background.

Video tutorials that follow each level of spyciness (pun intended) can be found on YouTube: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLh9Doml-QAqdPUCEt3Y0-0p-iAmcQA8G. 

I welcome any/all suggestions in order to improve the code (or correct the typos).
Feel free to use the code for educational purposes (do not forget to give credit).
